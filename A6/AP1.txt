(a)  What is algebraic expression? How does it differs from mathematical formula?

By definition, algebraic expression is a mathematical expression or object built up from integers, variables, and the algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression]
For example, 2x - 1 is an algebraic expression.

Mathematical formula is a expression that denoting a statement about mathematical objects, and it can be evaluated to true or false, depending on the values that are given to the variables occurring in the expressions.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)]
For example, 2x - 1 > 12x is a mathematical formula.

(b)  What is term rewriting?  Is it the same as symbolic computation?

Rewriting is a part of symbolic computation, it covers a wide range of methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms.
In symbolic computation (is the computation with symbolic expressions), the simplification during this computation is normally done through rewriting.

(d)  What is the difference between evaluation and interpretation (in math sense)?

Evaluation is in the given expression substitute the given value for the variable and calculate the result
Interpretation is

(e)  What is lazy evaluation comparing with eager evaluation?
Eager evaluation an expression is evaluated as soon as it is bound to a variable. An opposite alternative to eager evaluation is lazy evaluation: which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations (sharing).

(f)  How functional programming related to algebra systems?

(g)  Is lambda function in Python are placement for symbolic computation?  If yes, why?  If not, why not?  Provideat least two examples.
